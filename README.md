# What is PyFFS

PyFFS is a python implementation of Levenshtein automata, whose goal 
is to provide fast 
[fuzzy search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching)
of words among a dictionary. The code is currently written in pure python 
so the speed gains are only relevant where searching through really big dictionaries.
